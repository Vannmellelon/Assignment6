# Assignment 6


Sign Language Translator.

This assignment was to make a sign languague translator as a Single Page Application using the React.js framework. And host the application on Heroku.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Background


This application was developed as a part of the .NET Fullstack course at Noroff Accelerate.



## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
